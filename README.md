# PAC-MAN - パックマン

## Description

Pacman - A mini version implemented by scratch using HTML, CSS and JS without the use of any game engines.
This game was built to refresh my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Check out the live demo [here](https://pacman-by-rohithmsr.netlify.app/)

## Future Scope

- Implement Ghost AI (As of now, random movement algorithm is used and the ghosts can collide with each other. Ofcource, not Pacman xD)
- Add Extra lives and levels
- Sound Effects
